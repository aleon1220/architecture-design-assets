# architecture-design-assets
A centralized collection of reusable diagrams.net libraries, architecture templates, software architecture, cloud design (DevOps/SRE), and system documentation.

The primary goal of this repository is to decouple diagramming assets from specific projects, ensuring consistency and portability across different engagements and environments (Web, Confluence, VS Code).
